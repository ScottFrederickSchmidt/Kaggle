Unhappy customers don't stick around.

Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.\n\nIn this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.\n\nThe original dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction\n\n--------------\n## View Train Data\nThe train data is the most important dataset in which we try to find trends on the TARGET column, Y indepdendent variable.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405424Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.411147Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405647Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.410434Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_validate\nfrom statistics import mean\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nimport sklearn.metrics as metrics\n\nsample=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/sample_submission.csv'\ntrain=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv'\ntest=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/test.csv'\n\ndata=pd.read_csv(train)\nprint(data.shape) #(76020, 371)\ndata.head() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-26T01:44:19.070663Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-26T01:44:19.071015Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-26T01:44:23.924560Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-26T01:44:19.070983Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-26T01:44:23.923669Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Find Missing Values\nNo missing values!
