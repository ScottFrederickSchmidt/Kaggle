Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.\n\nSantander Bank is asking Kagglers to help them identify dissatisfied customers early in their relationship. Doing so would allow Santander to take proactive steps to improve a customer's happiness before it's too late.\n\nIn this competition, you'll work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.\n\nThe original dataset can be found on Kaggle: <br> https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction\n\n#### Summary\nUsing AUC as a metric:\n* Logistic regression is:  0.57\n\n--------------\n## View Train Data\nThe train data is the most important dataset in which we try to find trends on the TARGET column, Y indepdendent variable.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405424Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405674Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.411147Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.405647Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-26T01:02:28.410434Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_validate\nfrom statistics import mean\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_classification\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nimport sklearn.metrics as metrics\n\nsample=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/sample_submission.csv'\ntrain=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv'\ntest=r'/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/test.csv'\n\ndata=pd.read_csv(train)\ndata.drop_duplicates() #no duplicates\nprint(data.shape) #(76020, 371)\ndata.head() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-26T20:26:20.423158Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-26T20:26:20.423583Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-26T20:26:23.316316Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-26T20:26:20.423548Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-26T20:26:23.315449Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Find Missing Values\nThe dataset is still structured as (76020, 371) meaning all the columns must have been numeric.
